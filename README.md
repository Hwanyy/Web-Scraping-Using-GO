# Web-Scraping-Using-GO
Make Web Scraping model using Programming Language `Go`.

The Point of this Project is getting familiar with new language.

The strength of using `GO` is processing the data in an asynchronism way.
So it will finish work faster than `Python` does.

So i tried to scrape the Job Info from Indeed KR.

These work were followed by the lecture `NomadCoders`.
